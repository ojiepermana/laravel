## Highlights

## BNI Configuration Unification

- Unified Billing + Payment configuration into one file: `config/bni.php`
- New config namespaces:
  - `bni.billing.*`
  - `bni.payment.*`
- Environment variables are now separated to avoid collisions:
  - `BNI_BILLING_*`
  - `BNI_PAYMENT_*`

## Billing Naming Refactor

- Introduced new Billing classes with clearer naming:
  - `BniBillingClient`
  - `BniBillingEncryptor`
- Migrated usages, tests, and docs to the new names.

## Breaking Changes

- Legacy Billing classes were removed:
  - `BNIAPIServices`
  - `BNIEncryptServices`
- If your code references legacy classes, migrate to:
  - `OjiePermana\Laravel\Bank\BNI\Billing\BniBillingClient`
  - `OjiePermana\Laravel\Bank\BNI\Billing\BniBillingEncryptor`
